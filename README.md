# LibreChurch Website

This site is based on the evie template: Project site: https://evie.undraw.co

An MIT licensed template bundled with a minimal style guide to build websites faster, especially combined with illustrations from [unDraw](https://undraw.co). It is extemely lightweight, customizable and works perfectly on modern browsers.

## WIP

This branch develops a Hugo template for the existing LibreChurch one-page-html-draft.
